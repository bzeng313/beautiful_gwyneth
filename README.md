# beautiful_gwyneth
A simple script using Twilio text messaging API to send automated texts telling my girlfriend she's beautiful :).

You can use the script too. Just sign up for a Twilio account and phone number, enter the Twilio number, your
significant other's phone number, Twilio Account SID, and Twilio Auth Token. 

I chose to automate my script by setting up a chron job in a free tier AWS instance. But whatever floats your
boat.
